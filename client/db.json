Validations ensure that incorrect data doesn’t reach the backend servers and, eventually the databases. Ideally, most software data is validated at every layer, i.e., the Frontend, Backend, and Database.",

      "content": "The HoverAir X1 may have popularized easy-to-use selfie drones, but it’s DJI’s new $199 Neo we’ve been testing that looks set to dominate sales. It’s launching globally today and does almost everything the $350 X1 can do and so much more.  Like the X1, DJI’s new Neo is a drone you primarily buy to record yourself doing things for social media. It flies itself, no controller necessary — you simply push a button on the drone to cycle through a list of predefined flights like follow, hover in place, orbit overhead, and zoom in and out. It launches in seconds, begins recording, and then returns to land in the palm of your hand without requiring previous flying experience."
